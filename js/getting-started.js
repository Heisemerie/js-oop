//OOP is a programming paradigm that is centered around objects rather than functions in procedural programming
console.log('hello world')

//The four pillars of OOP:
//Encapsulation: grouping related variables and functions into objects
//Abstraction: properties and methods can be hidden which simplifies the interface of the object and reduces the impact of change
//Inheritance: it allows to eliminate redundant code by allowing for creating generic objects from which other objects inherit properties and methods
//Polymorphism: allows for properties that behave differently depending on the object being referenced. Refactor ugly switch/case statements

//OOP solves the problem of interdependecy (spaghetti code) & repitition in Procedural programming
